I have 3 example files currently
cd examples
ruby example1.rb
ruby example2.rb
ruby example3.rb

Not Scenario yet complete due to first requirment being to filter data.
The scenario will be in this file once complete. Currently loads data and initialise table.
ruby scenario.rb

To Complete:
Not sure on the first 2, these are possible but require a fetch, map and save operation.

- It should be possible to do all of the following row manipulations:
   * Run a transformation on a row which changes its content
     based on the return value of a block.
     (Similar to Enumerable#map)

- It should be possible to do all of the following column manipulations:
    * Run a transformation on a column which changes its content
      based on the return value of a block.


b = table.fetch( 0 ).map! do |item|
   item = item * 2
end
table.save_row( 0, b)


cola = table.fetch_column( "third" ).map! do |item|
   item = item * 2
end
table.save_column( "third", cola )



These Requirments are not complete
- It should be possible to do the following filtering:
    * Reduce a table to contain only the rows that pass a conditional
      block (similar to Enumerable#select)
    * Reduce a table to contain only the columns that pass a
      conditional block (similar to Enumerable#select)

I understand filtering out some rows on the basis that they do not meet a requirment for a column. 
I do not currently understand the scenario for a row passing a condition, stuck on the implementation.
