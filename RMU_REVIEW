I have built a class Tabular::Table which encapsulates an Array of Arrays, with methods for standard row and column based functions.

The README.md and examples1-4 should demonstrate how to use the class. In the examples folder there is also a scenario.rb file, this creates the output file in the data folder.

    cd example
    ruby scenario.rb

I believe that I have completed all the requirments for this assignment.
